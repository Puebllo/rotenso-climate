# Rotenso AC ESPHome

This project provides custom external component to control Rotenso AC and probably other daughter-brands from TLC ACs ([midea component](https://esphome.io/components/climate/midea.html) is not working for this AC brand, completely different data packets).

> [!WARNING]
> **It's still work in progress.**
> 
> _I don't guarantee that using this external component won't damage your AC (It shouldn't though, if you send wrong data packet then AC won't even budge, ask me how I know it)_

> [!NOTE]
> This project will be open-source forever. I did this component for my personal purposes but I think many other may benefit from it.
> 
> If you like this project and want to support it, you can consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pabllo)
> 
> You can also support this project by letting me know, for which AC brands/models it also works

## How I did this

By reverse engineering hundreds of data packets from WiFi module ;) Change one option in SmartLife app at a time, observe changes in frames, and deduct meaning of bytes ( so far it works :) )

## Tested with AC

- [x] Rotenso Elis Series 3,5kW


## What's working

- [x] Receiving state updates
- [x] Mode selection (Off, Cool, Heat, Fan)
- [x] Preset selection (Eco, Turbo)
- [x] Set fan speed (Auto, Low, Mid, High)
- [x] Set temperature with decimal (0.5\*C changes)

## ToDo:

### ESPHome

- [ ] Expose Dry Mode
- [ ] Config repo, so ESPHome can fetch directly this component without manual upload to `config` dir

### Common AC functionality:

- [ ] Horizontal Flaps control
- [ ] Vertical Flaps control
- [ ] Custom Fan speed setting (Fan speed from 1-5, auto) instead of mapping to ESPHome default ones
- [ ] On/Off display on indoor unit
- [ ] On/Off Beeper
- [ ] Function Sleep

### For some AC Units:

- [ ] I Feel (reading temp from remote)
- [ ] Smart 8\*C
- [ ] Anti-Mildew
- [ ] Self Clean
- [ ] Gentle wind (vertical flaps close with extra steps)
- [ ] Health (Air purification)

## ESPHome setup
1. Download/clone this repo
2. In HomeAssistant Config directory, go to `esphome` and create there directory `custom_components` in which paste downloaded repo, rename folder to `rotenso`. See screen below

3. In ESPHome add following to yml:


```yml

external_components:
  - source: 
      type: local
      path: "./custom_components"
    components: [rotenso]

uart:
  id: uart_bus
  tx_pin: 1 # default pin
  rx_pin: 3 # default pin
  baud_rate: 9600
  parity: EVEN

climate:
  - platform: rotenso
    uart_id: uart_bus
    id: rotenso_climate
    name: "Rotenso AC"
```

4. Flash firmware. Done


## Hardware

tbc.

## Check for this WiFi module, if you have it, then it'll problably will work for you too

My AC is using generic TLCWBR Tuya module so my guess is, that if your AC is using this module, then this component should work you too.
